<h1>The Best Movies According to Martin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Let the Right One In</h3>
<p>
  This film and book are top notch. Love isn't always about romance is a good
  view of it.
</p>
<h3>Full Metal Jacket</h3>
<p>It's like two movies in one. Just a simple story about a very deep topic.</p>
<h3>Clifford</h3>
<p>Underrated Martin Short film. Needs more love.</p>
